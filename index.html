                “Marks do not measure that IQ but the discipline in a student”.
                
                Discipline is a concept everyone is aware of, but few truly understand. The most successful people in life exert discipline on a daily basis. It is vital to every living being and without it the world around us would be chaos.
                
                Discipline brings stability and structure into a persons life. It teaches a person to be responsive and respectful.
                
                Think of athletics: discipline is the fundamental aspect on which sports have been created. Every player must adhere to the rules of the game.
                
                Discipline helps to train a person's mind and character, building a sense of self control and the practice of obedience.
                
                The ability can be developed or strengthened at any given time if you put your mind to it. Make promises and make sure you deliver. Make the genuine effort to align your actions and behaviours, instead focus on all of the positive attributes.
                
                And lastly, Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishments.
                
                May the Almighty bless us with insights and expression.
